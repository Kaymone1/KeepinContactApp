## Unsolved Mysteries
- When I click the delete button, it doesn't show me who was deleted it comes out as "deleted: null". Maybe the contacts variable I used may need to be altered.
- I wanted to create a header with the logo image I generated but had trouble figuring out how to make image not take over the entire page.
